https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
and the dataset i used for the faces in being adding in one folder name dataset.

C) Within 80 words summarize why you chose the particular algorithm in question A
Ans) I uses Haarcascade method for the face detection as haarcascade_frontalface because 
I it very easy to use and understand . It make the rectangle to detect the face easy.
I uses OpenCV library to capture the image/yours photo as it easy to use .
And i uses the Deepface librery ,it is too good library as it can predict the emotion,age,race etc
very easly as comepair to other library for emotion detection.
